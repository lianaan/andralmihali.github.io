I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the laboratory of [Guillermo Horga](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research-labs/horga-lab), in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University. My work aims to develop and employ objective measures for people’s insight and metacognition, understand their computational and neural mechanisms, as well as what drives people’s variability in these processes, in the context of psychopathology and sublinical variation. I am also interested in how biases in decision-making arise, what purpose they serve and strategies to counteract them, either employed by the decision-making agent, or shaped with behavioral intervention. 



Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Neural Science in 2018 from New York University, under the mentorship of [Wei Ji Ma](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/).  During my [Ph.D.](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/static/files/publications/2018%20Andra%20Mihali%20PhD%20thesis.pdf), I worked on developing behavioral and eye-tracking tasks and Bayesian models  to quantify and understand differences in the precisions of visual representations and perceptual decisions, in neurotypical individuals as well as individuals with ADHD. Before that, I received my B.A. in Biochemistry, with minors Psychology and Mathematics, in 2011, from Columbia University.

I am passionate about the intersection of science and society (e.g., [Scaan](https://scaan.net/)), data analysis and visualization, mentorship, hiking, [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andram/albums/72157649066170538/with/3164862536), baking and dancing, especially zumba and Argentine tango.
