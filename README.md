# About me
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene in prof. Guillermo Horga's lab. During my PhD with prof. Wei Ji Ma, I worked on developing tasks aimed to quantify and understand differences in the precisions of visual representations and perceptual decisions, in neurotypicals as well as observers with ADHD. To this end, I used psychophysics, eye tracking and computational modeling. I joined Dr. Horga's lab with the aim of combining these methods with neural measures of dopamine function to better understand psychosis and inform individualized treatment. My current project focuses on developing psychophysical markers to quantify perceptual distortions and understand how people make use of and update beliefs about the reliability of their sensory information.
