The history of tango dance, music and poetry is linked to the history of Argentina and Uruguay. Tango developed in the mid 1800s, as a means of artistic expression of the working class people of Buenos Aires and it combined Argentine milonga, as well European and African elements. Tango experienced a decline in the 1950s, as military dictatorships imposed severe restrictions on all social gatherings, dancing included. Since the 1980s, partly due to an increased Western interest in its means of expression, tango experienced an international revival as well as evolution, partly through the development of tango nuevo.  Tango dancing requires and further inspires balance, precision of motion and elegance, akin to ballet, but more accessible, and also with a social component, through synchronization with your partner’s movements. In 2009, tango has been inscribed in the UNESCO list as a cultural heritage of humanity. People come to tango to dance and exercise, fine-tune and express their musicality,  learn about the culture of Argentina and Uruguay, experience connection, process grief, heal post break-ups, socialize, develop their trust in themselves and others, find community, find a mindfulness practice, embrace others,  understand, amplify and share their feelings.
